# Hand Gesture Recognition Database
This repository contains a Python-based hand gesture recognition database and tools for training machine learning models to recognize hand gestures from images or video data.
Table of Contents Overview Features Installation Usage Dataset Training the Model Testing the Model Visualization Contributing License Overview This project focuses on recognizing hand gestures using machine learning techniques, including deep learning and computer vision models. The goal is to provide a robust dataset and utilities to train and test models that can identify different hand gestures from real-time data or images
# Features
Preprocessed dataset of hand gestures. Code for training models using various machine learning algorithms (e.g., CNN, RNN). Tools for data augmentation and visualization. Real-time gesture recognition from live video feed. Compatibility with major machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV). Installation Prerequisites Python 3.x TensorFlow or PyTorch OpenCV for video and image processing Numpy, Pandas for data handling Matplotlib or Seaborn for data visualization Install the necessary dependencies

git clone https://github.com/samarthgarde007/ML-4-Python-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Database/edit/main/README.md cd hand-gesture-recognition-database Usage Dataset The dataset contains images or video frames of various hand gestures. Each gesture is labeled with a specific class. The dataset is split into train, test, and validation sets.

You can download the dataset from Dataset Link.

Training the Model You can train the model using the provided training script. Ensure that the dataset path is set correctly in the configuration file.
